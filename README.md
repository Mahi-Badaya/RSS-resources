RSS is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. 
Websites usually use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information, such as blog entries, news headlines, or episodes of audio and video series.
It is also used to distribute podcasts. An RSS document includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author's name.
